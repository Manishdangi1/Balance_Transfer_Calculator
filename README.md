Balance Transfer Savings Calculator
This tool helps users compare their current loan EMI with a potential lower-interest balance transfer offer. By entering details like outstanding loan amount, current and new interest rates, remaining tenure, and optional processing fee, users can instantly calculate how much interest they could save—or lose—by switching lenders.
